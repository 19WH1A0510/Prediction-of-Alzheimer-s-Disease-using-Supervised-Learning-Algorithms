# Prediction-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease-using-Supervised-Learning-Algorithms
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in older adults. There is currently a lot of interest in applying machine learning to find out metabolic diseases like Alzheimer's and Diabetes that affect a large population of people around the world. Their incidence rates are increasing at an alarming rate every year. 

To assess if a person has Alzheimer’s disease, our goal is to build a decision tree-based predictor. This offers sufficient depth for a more thorough analysis of the features. It offers a clearer knowledge of the patients' conditions. This facilitates the work of medical professionals by offering a more accurate understanding of the disease.
